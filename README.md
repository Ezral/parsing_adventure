# webscraping_adventure

This is an project that I started with the intention to learn more about parsing and web scraping using Python.

After some research, I found [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-skills-web-scraping-javascript-using-python-97a29738353f) written by Kerry Parker, to whom I give full credit and thanks for providing a great resource, which I basically applied to achieve the result I wanted on my first script, the sayurbox_parser (plus some adjustments).
